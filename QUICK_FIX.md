# 🚀 Quick Fix for Images

## 🔍 **Debug Version Deployed**

I've added debug information to your PostCard component. Now when you visit your website, you'll see:

**On each post card:**
- **Black debug box**: Shows the first 30 characters of the image URL (if image is loading)
- **Red debug box**: Shows "No image: [reason]" (if image failed)

## 🧪 **How to Test:**

1. **Visit your website** (wait 2-3 minutes for deployment)
2. **Look at the post cards** on the homepage
3. **Check what the debug boxes say**:
   - Black box = Image URL is being passed correctly
   - Red box = Image URL is missing or invalid

## 🎯 **Expected Results:**

### **If you see BLACK debug boxes:**
- ✅ Image URLs are being passed correctly
- ❌ Images are failing to load (Next.js or network issue)
- **Solution**: Check browser console for errors

### **If you see RED debug boxes:**
- ❌ Image URLs are not being passed to component
- ❌ Image mapping not working
- **Solution**: Fix the posts utility

## 🔧 **Most Likely Issues:**

### **Issue 1: Build vs Runtime**
- Image mapping loaded at build time
- Not available at runtime
- **Fix**: Move image mapping to public folder or API route

### **Issue 2: Path Resolution**
- Image mapping path not resolving correctly
- **Fix**: Use absolute paths or different loading method

### **Issue 3: Next.js Image Optimization**
- Unsplash images being blocked by Next.js
- **Fix**: Check if domain is properly configured

## 📱 **What to Check:**

1. **Visit your website** and look for debug boxes
2. **Open browser console** (F12) and look for errors
3. **Tell me what you see** in the debug boxes
4. **Share any console errors**

## 🎯 **Next Steps:**

Based on what the debug boxes show, I'll apply the right fix:

- **Black boxes + console errors** = Fix Next.js image loading
- **Red boxes** = Fix image mapping loading
- **No debug boxes** = Component not rendering properly
