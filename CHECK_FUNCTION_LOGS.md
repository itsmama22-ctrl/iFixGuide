# 🔍 Check Function Logs (Not Build Logs)

I can see your **Build Logs** are still running (55 seconds). That's normal and won't show email errors.

## 🎯 We Need Function Logs Instead

**The Build Logs show:**
- ✅ Dependencies installing
- ✅ Next.js detected (14.2.33) 
- ✅ Build process running
- ⚠️ Some npm warnings (normal, won't break email)

**Function Logs show:**
- 🚨 Email sending errors
- 📧 Resend API issues
- ❌ API key problems

## 📍 How to Find Function Logs

**In the same Vercel page you're on:**

1. **Look for tabs** at the top: "Deployment", "Logs", "Resources", "Source"
2. **Click the "Logs" tab** (you're currently on "Build Logs")
3. **Look for "Function Logs"** section
4. **Or scroll down** to find "Runtime Logs"

**Alternative:**
1. **Go to:** https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. **Click:** iFixGuide project
3. **Click:** "Functions" tab
4. **Look for:** `/api/newsletter` and `/api/contact`

## 🔍 What to Look For

**In Function Logs, look for:**

- ❌ `Error sending email`
- ❌ `401 Unauthorized` (wrong API key)
- ❌ `403 Forbidden` (invalid API key)  
- ❌ `Email sending error: ...`
- ✅ `Email sent successfully` (if working)

## 🚀 While We Wait - Quick Alternative

**Since Resend might be complex, want me to switch to Web3Forms?**

**Web3Forms is simpler:**
- ✅ No API key complexity
- ✅ Works in 2 minutes
- ✅ No account verification
- ✅ Just enter your email and go

**Say "switch to Web3Forms" and I'll set it up immediately!**

## 📋 Next Steps

1. **Find Function Logs** in Vercel
2. **Tell me what errors you see** (or screenshot)
3. **OR** let me switch to Web3Forms for instant email
