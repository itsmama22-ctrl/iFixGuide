**Q: Why does app come back after deleting?**
A: Automatic Downloads enabled, or syncing from iCloud. Disable in App Store settings.

## Conclusion

**Quick fixes:**
1. Check Screen Time restrictions (2 minutes)
2. Use Settings > iPhone Storage method (1 minute)
3. Restart iPhone (2 minutes)
4. Try offload instead (preserves data)

Most app deletion issues are due to Screen Time restrictions or trying to delete system apps. Check restrictions first, then try alternative deletion methods.
