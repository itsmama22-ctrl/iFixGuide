iPhone shutting down at 20%, 30%, or even 50% battery is frustrating and indicates battery problems. This guide explains why it happens and how to fix it.

## Why iPhone Dies with Battery Left

**Primary cause: Battery degradation**

Lithium-ion batteries lose capacity over time. Degraded battery can't provide power at lower voltage levels, causing shutdowns.

**Other causes:**
- Battery needs calibration
- Extreme cold temperature
- Power-intensive apps
- iOS bugs

## Check Battery Health First

**Critical step:**
1. **Settings** > **Battery** > **Battery Health & Charging**
2. Check **Maximum Capacity**
3. Check **Peak Performance Capability**

**If below 80%:**
- Battery significantly degraded
- Shutdowns expected
- **Needs replacement**

**If shows "Service" message:**
- Battery health critical
- Replace immediately

## Solutions to Fix Early Shutdowns

### 1. Calibrate Battery

Fixes inaccurate percentage readings.

**Full calibration:**
1. Drain completely to 0% (let shut off)
2. Leave off for 3-4 hours
3. Charge to 100% uninterrupted
4. Leave plugged in 2 more hours
5. Use normally

**May help if:**
- Battery Health above 85%
- Started after iOS update
- Percentage seems inaccurate

### 2. Update iOS

Battery management improvements.

**To update:**
1. **Settings** > **General** > **Software Update**
2. Install updates
3. Often includes power management fixes

### 3. Avoid Extreme Cold

Cold causes temporary shutdowns.

**Why:**
- Batteries perform poorly in cold
- Below 32°F (0°C) significantly reduced
- Temporary - returns to normal when warm

**Solutions:**
- Keep iPhone warm
- Inside pocket close to body
- Don't use in extreme cold
- Returns to normal at room temp

### 4. Close Power-Intensive Apps

Heavy apps drain battery fast.

**Close:**
- Games
- Video streaming
- GPS/navigation
- Camera

**Check battery usage:**
1. **Settings** > **Battery**
2. See which apps drain most
3. Limit usage of battery hogs

### 5. Enable Low Power Mode

Extends battery to avoid shutdowns.

**Enable:**
1. **Settings** > **Battery** > **Low Power Mode** > ON
2. Or Control Center > Battery icon

**Helps battery last longer** but doesn't fix underlying issue.

### 6. Reset All Settings

Fixes battery monitoring glitches.

**Steps:**
1. **Settings** > **General** > **Transfer or Reset iPhone**
2. **Reset** > **Reset All Settings**
3. Doesn't delete data

**Then recalibrate battery.**

### 7. Restore iPhone

For persistent software issues.

**⚠️ Backup first!**

1. Backup to iCloud/computer
2. Restore to factory settings
3. Set up as new
4. Test battery
5. If fixed, restore from backup

### 8. Replace Battery

**Best solution if Battery Health below 80%.**

**Apple battery replacement:**
- Cost: $69-99
- Genuine Apple battery
- Fixes shutdowns completely
- Improves performance dramatically

**Worth it if:**
- Battery Health below 85%
- iPhone otherwise works well
- Cheaper than new iPhone
- Adds 2-3 years of life

## Why Battery Replacement Fixes This

**New battery:**
- 100% capacity
- Can provide power at all levels
- No unexpected shutdowns
- Accurate percentage
- All-day battery life

**Old battery:**
- Reduced capacity
- Can't provide peak power
- Shutdowns at low percentage
- Inaccurate readings

## Temporary Workarounds

**Until you can replace battery:**
1. Keep charged above 40%
2. Use Low Power Mode
3. Carry power bank
4. Close battery-intensive apps
5. Avoid cold weather use

**These help but don't fix the problem.**

## When to Replace Battery

**Replace immediately if:**
- Shuts down above 20% regularly
- Battery Health below 80%
- "Service" recommendation
- iPhone 2+ years old
- Unexpected shutdowns frequent

**Can wait if:**
- Only happens occasionally
- Battery Health above 85%
- Happens only in extreme cold
- Recent iOS update (may improve)

## Prevention (For New Battery)

**Extend new battery lifespan:**
1. Use Optimized Battery Charging
2. Avoid extreme temperatures
3. Don't let drain to 0% regularly
4. Charge between 20-80% when possible
5. Update iOS regularly

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Why does iPhone die at 30% but shows 100% after charging?**
A: Battery can't hold charge properly. Severely degraded - needs replacement.

**Q: Will calibration fix shutdowns?**
A: Only if percentage is inaccurate but battery healthy. If degraded (below 80%), only replacement fixes it.

**Q: Is it normal for iPhone to shut down at 20%?**
A: If happens occasionally in cold, normal. If happens regularly, battery degradation issue.

**Q: How long does new battery last?**
A: 2-3 years typically before dropping below 80% with normal use.

**Q: Can I prevent battery degradation?**
A: Can slow it but not prevent. All batteries degrade over time. Good charging habits help.

## Conclusion

**If Battery Health below 80%:**
- **Replace battery** (only real fix)
- $69-99 at Apple
- Fixes shutdowns completely
- Dramatically improves iPhone

**If Battery Health above 85%:**
- Try calibration
- Update iOS
- May be software issue

**Reality:** iPhone dying early almost always means degraded battery needs replacement. Calibration and updates help only if battery still healthy.

**Best solution:** Battery replacement at Apple Store. Worth the $69-99 investment for 2-3 more years of reliable iPhone use.
