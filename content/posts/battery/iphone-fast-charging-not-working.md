Fast charging gets iPhone to 50% in 30 minutes. When not working, this guide fixes it.

## Fast Charging Requirements

**Needs all of these:**
- iPhone 8 or newer
- 20W or higher USB-C power adapter
- USB-C to Lightning cable (or USB-C to USB-C for iPhone 15+)
- iOS 11.2 or later

## 8 Fixes for Fast Charging

### 1. Verify Adapter Wattage
Check adapter says 20W or higher. 5W, 12W, or 18W won't fast charge. Need 20W minimum.

### 2. Use Correct Cable
Must be USB-C to Lightning (or USB-C to USB-C for iPhone 15). USB-A cables can't fast charge.

### 3. Check Cable Quality
Use Apple or MFi certified cable. Cheap cables don't support fast charging.

### 4. Remove Case
Cases trap heat. Fast charging slows above 80% or if too hot. Remove case.

### 5. Don't Use While Charging
Usage slows charging. Lock screen for fastest charge.

### 6. Update iOS
Settings > General > Software Update. Charging optimizations in updates.

### 7. Check Battery Health
Below 80% capacity charges slower. Settings > Battery > Battery Health.

### 8. Try Different Outlet
Test different wall outlet or power source.

## Fast Charging Speed

**Expected:**
- 0-50%: 30 minutes
- 0-80%: 1 hour
- 80-100%: Slows significantly (battery protection)

**If slower:**
- Check adapter is 20W+
- Verify using USB-C cable
- Remove case
- Don't use iPhone

## Optimized Battery Charging

**Feature slows charging intentionally:**
- Charges to 80% fast
- Waits to complete to 100%
- Extends battery life

**To bypass:**
- Tap notification > "Charge to 100% Now"

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Will any 20W charger work?**
A: Yes, any quality 20W+ USB-C adapter works. Apple, Anker, Belkin all good.

**Q: Why does fast charging slow after 80%?**
A: Normal. Protects battery from stress of high charge levels.

**Q: Can I fast charge overnight?**
A: Yes, safe. But not necessary - regular charging fine overnight.

## Conclusion
Fast charging requires 20W+ USB-C adapter and USB-C to Lightning cable. Verify you have both. Most "not working" is using wrong adapter or cable. Upgrade to proper accessories for fast charging.
