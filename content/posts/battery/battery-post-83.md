'Liquid Detected in Lightning Connector' or 'Charging Not Available' warnings prevent charging. Here's how to fix it safely.

## What to Do Immediately

### 1. Don't Force Charge
Never override warning. Can cause permanent damage or fire hazard.

### 2. Tap Back of iPhone
Gently tap back to help water drain out of port.

### 3. Dry Naturally
Leave iPhone in dry location, port facing down. Wait 30 minutes minimum.

## Safe Drying Methods

### Air Dry (Best)
- Place in dry, room temperature area
- Port facing down
- Good air circulation
- Wait 1-24 hours depending on moisture

### Fan Method
- Place iPhone near fan (not on)
- Room temperature air only
- Helps evaporation
- 3-6 hours

### Silica Gel
- Place in container with silica gel packets
- Seal container
- Wait 12-24 hours

## What NOT to Do

### Never:
- Use hair dryer (heat damages)
- Microwave (destroys iPhone)
- Rice (ineffective, adds dust)
- Compressed air directly into port
- Cotton swabs (leave lint)
- Charge before dry

## How Long to Wait

**Light moisture:** 30 minutes - 1 hour
**Brief water exposure:** 3-6 hours  
**Submerged:** 12-24 hours

**Test:** If warning still appears, wait longer.

## After Drying

**When dry:**
1. Plug in Lightning cable
2. If no warning, can charge
3. If warning persists, wait longer

## Emergency Charging

**If urgent:**
- Use wireless charging (if iPhone 8+)
- Works even with wet port
- Doesn't trigger liquid warning

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Can I use iPhone while port dries?**
A: Yes, just can't charge via cable. Use wireless charging if needed.

**Q: How did water get in if iPhone water-resistant?**
A: Water resistance degrades over time. Humid environments can trigger sensor.

**Q: Will port dry on its own?**
A: Yes, eventually. Waiting is safest method.

## Conclusion
Never force charge wet iPhone. Wait for natural drying 30 minutes to 24 hours depending on moisture level. Use wireless charging if urgent. Most ports dry completely within hours.
