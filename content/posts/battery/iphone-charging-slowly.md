Slow iPhone charging is frustrating. If your iPhone takes hours to charge or charging seems slower than before, this guide has the solutions.

## Why iPhone Charges Slowly

**Common causes:**
- Low-wattage charger (5W vs 20W+)
- Damaged or non-certified cable
- Dirty charging port
- Background apps draining while charging
- Using iPhone while charging
- Extreme temperatures
- Battery degradation
- Software issues

## 10 Solutions to Speed Up Charging

### 1. Use Higher Wattage Charger

**Charging speeds by wattage:**
- 5W: 3+ hours (very slow)
- 12W: 2-2.5 hours
- 20W: 1-1.5 hours (fast charging)
- 30W+: Under 1 hour (fastest)

**Fast charging requires:**
- iPhone 8 or newer
- 20W+ USB-C power adapter
- USB-C to Lightning cable (or USB-C to USB-C for iPhone 15+)

**Recommendation:** Get Apple 20W USB-C adapter or certified equivalent

### 2. Use Original or Certified Cable

**Cable quality matters:**
- Cheap cables charge slowly or not at all
- Use original Apple cable
- Or MFi (Made for iPhone) certified cable

**Check cable for:**
- Fraying or damage
- Bent connectors
- Works with other devices

**Replace if damaged** - cables wear out after 1-2 years

### 3. Clean Charging Port

**Lint blocks connection:**
1. Turn off iPhone
2. Use wooden toothpick
3. Gently scrape out debris
4. Don't use metal objects
5. Blow out loosened lint

**Signs port is dirty:**
- Cable doesn't click in
- Wobbles when plugged in
- Intermittent charging

### 4. Don't Use iPhone While Charging

**Usage slows charging:**
- Gaming: Very slow or no progress
- Video streaming: Significantly slower
- Heavy apps: Minimal charging

**For fastest charge:**
- Don't use iPhone
- Or use minimal apps only
- Lock screen best

### 5. Close Background Apps

**Apps drain while charging:**
1. Swipe up from bottom
2. Close all apps
3. Especially close:
   - Games
   - Streaming apps
   - GPS/navigation
   - Video apps

**Background refresh:**
- Settings > General > Background App Refresh > OFF

### 6. Enable Airplane Mode

**Wireless radios use power:**
1. Control Center
2. Tap Airplane Mode
3. Charges 20-30% faster

**Alternative:** Disable WiFi, Bluetooth, Cellular individually

### 7. Remove Case While Charging

**Cases trap heat:**
- Heat slows charging
- Remove thick cases
- Better airflow = faster charging

**Especially important for:**
- Fast charging
- Wireless charging
- Warm environments

### 8. Restart iPhone

**Software glitches affect charging:**

**Force restart:**
- iPhone 8+: Volume Up, Down, hold Side
- iPhone 7: Hold Volume Down + Power
- iPhone 6s: Hold Home + Power

### 9. Update iOS

**Charging improvements in updates:**
1. Settings > General > Software Update
2. Install available updates
3. Often includes charging optimizations

### 10. Check Battery Health

**Degraded battery charges slower:**
1. Settings > Battery > Battery Health & Charging
2. Check Maximum Capacity

**If below 80%:**
- Consider battery replacement
- Charging slow is symptom of degradation

## Charging Method Comparison

**Wired (Fast):**
- 20W+ adapter: Fastest (50% in 30 min)
- 12W adapter: Moderate (50% in 1 hour)
- 5W adapter: Slow (50% in 2+ hours)

**Wireless:**
- MagSafe: Moderate (15W max)
- Qi wireless: Slow (7.5W max)
- Always slower than wired

**Computer USB:**
- Very slow (2.5-5W typically)
- Use only as last resort

## Fast Charging Tips

**To maximize fast charging:**
1. Use 20W+ USB-C adapter
2. Use USB-C to Lightning cable (or USB-C to USB-C)
3. Enable Airplane Mode
4. Don't use iPhone
5. Remove case
6. Start charging below 80%

**Fast charging slows after 80%** - this is normal to protect battery

## Wireless Charging Optimization

**For faster wireless charging:**
1. Use MagSafe (15W) vs standard Qi (7.5W)
2. Remove case (especially thick ones)
3. Center iPhone on charger
4. Don't use iPhone during charge
5. Ensure charger has adequate power adapter

**Wireless always slower than wired**

## Temperature Effects

**Extreme temps slow charging:**

**Too hot (>95°F/35°C):**
- Charging stops or very slow
- Let cool before charging
- Remove from direct sunlight

**Too cold (<32°F/0°C):**
- Charging slows significantly
- Warm to room temperature first
- Don't force charge when cold

**Ideal charging temp:** 62-72°F (16-22°C)

## Optimized Battery Charging

**Feature that intentionally slows:**
- Charges to 80% quickly
- Waits to reach 100%
- Extends battery lifespan

**To temporarily bypass:**
1. Tap charging notification
2. "Charge to 100% Now"

**Don't disable permanently** - helps battery longevity

## When Charging Should Be Faster

**Expected charging times (with 20W charger):**
- 0-50%: 30 minutes
- 0-80%: 1 hour
- 0-100%: 1.5-2 hours

**If significantly slower:**
- Check adapter wattage
- Verify cable quality
- Clean port
- Check battery health

## Hardware Issues

**When hardware is problem:**
- Port damaged/loose
- Battery severely degraded
- Charging circuit failure

**Signs:**
- Very slow regardless of charger
- Port feels loose
- Intermittent charging
- Started after damage

**Next steps:**
- Apple Store diagnostic
- Port or battery replacement
- Check warranty

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Why does my iPhone charge slowly with original charger?**
A: Original chargers are often 5W (very slow). Upgrade to 20W for fast charging.

**Q: Is it bad to fast charge iPhone?**
A: No, iPhones are designed for it. Fast charging to 80%, then slows to protect battery.

**Q: Why does charging slow down after 80%?**
A: Normal behavior to protect battery from stress of high charge levels.

**Q: Can I leave iPhone charging overnight?**
A: Yes, Optimized Battery Charging manages this. Won't overcharge.

**Q: How can I tell if cable is certified?**
A: Look for MFi logo on packaging or "Made for iPhone" text.

## Conclusion

**Fastest charging method:**
1. 20W+ USB-C adapter
2. Certified USB-C to Lightning cable
3. Airplane Mode ON
4. Don't use iPhone
5. Room temperature
6. Remove case

**Most common slow charging causes:**
- Low-wattage charger (5W)
