iPhone Battery Health tells you how much your battery has degraded. Understanding what the numbers mean helps you know when to replace your battery and how to maintain it.

## What is Battery Health?

**Found in:** Settings > Battery > Battery Health & Charging

**Shows two main things:**
1. **Maximum Capacity** - Battery's current capacity vs. new (100%)
2. **Peak Performance Capability** - Whether iPhone is throttled

## Maximum Capacity Explained

### What the Percentage Means

**100%:**
- Brand new battery
- Or recently replaced
- Full original capacity

**95-99%:**
- Excellent health
- Normal after 6-12 months
- No concern

**90-94%:**
- Good health
- Normal after 1-2 years
- Still performs well

**85-89%:**
- Fair health
- Noticeable battery life reduction
- Consider replacement within year

**80-84%:**
- Degraded
- Apple recommends service
- Performance may be throttled

**Below 80%:**
- Significantly degraded
- Strong recommendation to replace
- Performance throttling likely

### What Affects Maximum Capacity

**Normal degradation factors:**
- **Age** - All batteries degrade over time
- **Charge cycles** - Each full 0-100% cycle wears battery
- **Usage patterns** - Heavy use degrades faster
- **Charging habits** - Constant 100% charge accelerates wear

**Accelerated degradation:**
- Extreme temperatures
- Fast charging frequently
- Letting battery die completely often
- Cheap third-party chargers
- Always at 100% or 0%

## Peak Performance Capability

### What It Means

**"Your battery is currently supporting normal peak performance":**
- Battery healthy enough
- No throttling occurring
- iPhone runs at full speed

**"This iPhone has experienced an unexpected shutdown":**
- Battery can't provide peak power
- iPhone may throttle to prevent shutdowns
- Time to consider replacement

**"Performance management applied":**
- iPhone actively throttling CPU/GPU
- Prevents unexpected shutdowns
- Apps slower, animations lag
- Replacement recommended

## Battery Degradation Timeline

### Expected Degradation Rates

**Typical iPhone usage:**
- **6 months:** 96-98%
- **1 year:** 92-96%
- **1.5 years:** 88-94%
- **2 years:** 85-90%
- **2.5 years:** 80-86%
- **3 years:** 75-82%

**Heavy usage:**
- Faster degradation
- May hit 80% in 18 months

**Light usage:**
- Slower degradation
- May maintain 90%+ for 2+ years

### Factors That Speed Up Degradation

**Bad habits:**
- Gaming while charging
- Using in extreme heat/cold
- Constant fast charging
- Leaving at 100% for days
- Letting die to 0% regularly

**Good habits slow degradation:**
- Charge between 20-80%
- Avoid extreme temperatures
- Use Optimized Battery Charging
- Remove case while charging
- Regular iOS updates

## When to Replace Battery

### Clear Indicators

**Replace immediately if:**
- Below 80% capacity
- "Service" recommendation
- Unexpected shutdowns
- Performance severely throttled
- Battery swollen (stop using!)

**Consider replacing if:**
- 80-85% and noticeable issues
- iPhone 2+ years old
- Heavy daily user
- Plan to keep iPhone 2+ more years

**Can wait if:**
- Above 85% and working fine
- Light usage
- Battery lasts full day
- No performance issues

### Battery Replacement Benefits

**After replacement:**
- Back to 100% capacity
- All-day battery life
- No performance throttling
- Feels like new iPhone
- 2-3 more years of life

## How to Maintain Battery Health

### Daily Habits

**Charging:**
- Don't let die to 0%
- Don't always charge to 100%
- Ideal range: 20-80%
- Unplug at 80-90% if using immediately

**Usage:**
- Avoid intensive tasks while charging
- Close background apps
- Use Low Power Mode when low
- Reduce screen brightness

### Long-Term Practices

**Temperature:**
- Keep 62-72°F (16-22°C)
- Avoid hot cars
- Don't use in direct sunlight
- Don't charge in hot environments

**Charging:**
- Use Optimized Battery Charging
- Original or MFi-certified chargers
- Avoid constant fast charging
- Remove case during charging

**Software:**
- Keep iOS updated
- Close unused apps
- Manage background refresh
- Restart weekly

## Features That Help Battery Health

### Optimized Battery Charging

**What it does:**
- Learns your routine
- Charges to 80%, waits
- Completes to 100% before you need it
- Significantly extends battery lifespan

**Enable:**
Settings > Battery > Battery Health & Charging > Optimized Battery Charging

### 80% Limit (iOS 17+)

**What it does:**
- Stops charging at 80%
- Maximum battery longevity
- Good for desk workers

**Enable:**
Settings > Battery > Battery Health & Charging > Charging Optimization > 80% Limit

## Common Battery Health Questions

### Why Did My Battery Health Drop Suddenly?

**Possible reasons:**
- Software recalibration
- iOS update changed calculation
- Temperature extremes
- Heavy usage period
- Natural degradation catching up

**What to do:**
- Monitor over next week
- If continues dropping fast, service needed
- One-time drop may be measurement adjustment

### Is 85% Battery Health Bad?

**Answer:** Fair, not terrible

**Expect:**
- Noticeably shorter battery life
- May need midday charge
- Still functional
- Should last 6-12 more months

**Consider:**
- Your usage needs
- How long keeping iPhone
- Whether battery lasts your day

### Can I Improve Battery Health Percentage?

**No, degradation is permanent**

**Can't reverse it, but can:**
- Slow future degradation
- Maximize remaining capacity
- Replace battery (resets to 100%)

## Battery Calibration

### What It Is

**Recalibrating battery:**
- Helps iPhone accurately report health
- Doesn't improve actual capacity
- Can fix incorrect readings

### How to Calibrate

**Steps:**
1. Drain to 0% (let iPhone shut off)
2. Leave off 3-4 hours
3. Charge to 100% uninterrupted
4. Leave plugged in 2 more hours
5. Use normally

**Do this:**
- Every 2-3 months
- After iOS update
- If battery percentage jumping
- If health percentage seems wrong

## Comparing to Other Phones

**iPhone battery health tracking:**
- One of few phones showing this
- Most Android phones don't display
- Transparency helps informed decisions

**Typical smartphone batteries:**
- All lithium-ion
- All degrade similarly
- iPhones not worse than others
- Just more visible in iPhone

## Third-Party Battery Apps

**Do they help?**
- Show same info as Settings
- Some show charge cycles
- Some show battery temperature
- Not necessary for most users

**Recommended apps:**
- coconutBattery (Mac only)
- 3uTools (detailed info)

**Built-in is sufficient** for most people.

## Battery Replacement Options

**Apple:**
- $69-99 depending on model
- Genuine battery
- Warranty maintained
- Recommended

**Third-party:**
- $40-70
- Quality varies
- May void warranty
- Check reviews

**DIY:**
- $20-40 parts
- Very difficult
- High risk
- Not recommended
