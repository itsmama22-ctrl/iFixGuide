NFC enables Apple Pay and NFC tag reading. When not working, this guide has solutions.

## 7 Fixes for NFC Issues

### 1. Enable NFC
iPhone 7-X: Automatic. iPhone XS+: Enabled by default. No toggle needed.

### 2. Position Correctly
Hold iPhone top (near camera) to NFC reader/tag. Not bottom or middle.

### 3. Remove Metal Case
Metal blocks NFC signals. Remove case and retry.

### 4. Set Up Apple Pay
Settings > Wallet & Apple Pay > Add Card. NFC requires Apple Pay setup for payments.

### 5. Restart iPhone
Force restart: Volume Up, Down, hold Side button.

### 6. Update iOS
Settings > General > Software Update. NFC improvements in updates.

### 7. Check iPhone Model
iPhone 6 and earlier: No NFC. iPhone 7+: NFC for Apple Pay. iPhone XS+: Full NFC.

## NFC Tag Reading

**iPhone XS and newer:**
- Automatic background reading
- No app needed for basic tags
- Hold top of iPhone to tag

**iPhone 7-X:**
- NFC only for Apple Pay
- Can't read NFC tags without third-party app

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Why won't Apple Pay work?**
A: NFC may be blocked by case, not positioned correctly, or card needs verification. Remove case and hold top of iPhone to reader.

**Q: Can I scan NFC tags on any iPhone?**
A: iPhone XS and newer: Yes. iPhone 7-X: Only with third-party apps. iPhone 6 and earlier: No.

**Q: Where is NFC antenna on iPhone?**
A: Top of iPhone, near cameras. Hold this area to NFC reader/tag.
