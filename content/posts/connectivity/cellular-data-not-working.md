Wait for full restart, then check cellular data.

### 4. Check Data Roaming Settings

Essential when traveling.

**To enable roaming:**
1. **Settings** > **Cellular** > **Cellular Data Options**
2. Turn on **Data Roaming**

**Note:** Roaming charges may apply. Check with carrier first.

**International travel:**
- Contact carrier about international plans

### 5. Update Carrier Settings

Carrier updates improve network performance.

**To check:**
1. Connect to Wi-Fi
2. Go to **Settings** > **General** > **About**
3. Wait 15-30 seconds

### 6. Reset Network Settings

Fixes most cellular data issues.

**Steps:**
1. **Settings** > **General** > **Transfer or Reset iPhone**
2. **Reset** > **Reset Network Settings**
3. Enter passcode
4. Confirm reset

**This erases:**
- Wi-Fi passwords
- Cellular settings

3. Download and install available updates
4. Keep iPhone charged during update

**Cellular fixes in updates:**
- Network connectivity improvements

### 9. Check for Carrier Outage

Network might be down in your area.

**How to check:**
- Visit carrier's website
- Check carrier's social media
- Search Twitter for "[Carrier name] down"
- Ask others on same carrier
- Check downdetector.com

**If carrier is down:**

3. Try different options:
   - 5G On
   - 5G Auto
   - LTE

**If on 5G:**

- Or try 3G as test (slower but may connect)

### 11. Disable VPN

VPN can interfere with cellular data.

**To disable:**
1. **Settings** > **VPN** (or **General** > **VPN & Device Management**)
2. Toggle off active VPN
3. Test cellular data

**If VPN was the issue:**
- Reconfigure VPN settings

**Before calling:**
- Have account number ready
- Know your phone number
- Check account status online
- Try other solutions first

## Advanced Troubleshooting

### Check APN Settings

Advanced users only—incorrect settings can break data.

**When to check:**
- Using third-party carrier
- Recently switched carriers
- International SIM card

**To check:**
1. **Settings** > **Cellular** > **Cellular Data Network**
2. Verify APN settings match carrier requirements
3. Contact carrier for correct settings

**⚠️ Don't change unless you know what you're doing.**

### Reset All Settings

More comprehensive than network reset.

1. **Settings** > **General** > **Transfer or Reset iPhone**
2. **Reset** > **Reset All Settings**
3. Enter passcode

Preserves data but resets all system settings.

### Restore iPhone

Last resort for persistent issues.

**⚠️ Erases everything. Backup first!**

1. Backup to iCloud or computer
2. Connect to computer
3. iTunes/Finder > Restore iPhone
4. Set up as new device
5. Test cellular before restoring backup

### Check for eSIM Issues (iPhone XS and newer)

If using eSIM:

1. **Settings** > **Cellular**

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Why does cellular data work on Wi-Fi but not cellular network?**
A: This question is contradictory—cellular data is the internet connection when NOT on Wi-Fi. If apps work on Wi-Fi but not cellular, enable cellular data for those apps in Settings.

**Q: Does resetting network settings delete photos?**
A: No, it only erases network-related settings (Wi-Fi passwords, etc.). Photos and apps are safe.

**Q: Why is my cellular data so slow?**
A: Could be network congestion, throttling (exceeded data cap), weak signal, or need to switch from 5G to LTE.

**Q: Can a bad SIM card cause no data?**
A: Yes, damaged or deactivated SIM prevents cellular service. Contact carrier for SIM replacement.

**Q: Why does cellular data work sometimes but not others?**
A: Usually due to signal strength variations, network congestion, or software glitches. Reset network settings.

## Conclusion

**Most effective fixes for cellular data:**

1. Reset Network Settings (fixes 60%+ of issues)
2. Toggle Airplane Mode
3. Restart iPhone
4. Update carrier settings
5. Remove and reinsert SIM card

**Quick fixes to try first:**
- Toggle Airplane Mode (30 seconds)
- Restart iPhone (1 minute)
- Check cellular data is enabled (15 seconds)

**If those don't work:**
- Reset Network Settings (most effective)
- Update iOS
- Contact carrier

Most cellular data problems are software-related and fixable at home. Hardware issues are rare.

**Remember:** Always backup before resets and updates. Keep carrier support number handy for account-related issues.

If cellular data worked before and suddenly stopped without you changing settings, it's likely a software glitch fixable with restart or network reset. If it never worked or stopped after physical damage, contact Apple Support.
