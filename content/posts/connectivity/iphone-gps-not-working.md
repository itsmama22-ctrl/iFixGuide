## Improving GPS Accuracy

### Use WiFi for Assisted GPS

### Give Apps Time to Lock

GPS needs time to acquire signal.

**Initial lock:**
- Can take 30 seconds to 2 minutes
- Especially if:
  - First use after restart
  - New location
  - Been indoors long time

**Be patient** - let app acquire GPS before moving.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Why is my iPhone location wrong by miles?**
A: Using WiFi/cell tower triangulation instead of GPS. Go outdoors, wait for GPS lock, or enable Precise Location.

**Q: How accurate is iPhone GPS?**
A: With good signal: 5-10 meters (16-32 feet). In ideal conditions: 3-5 meters.

**Q: Does GPS use cellular data?**
A: No, GPS uses satellites (free). But maps downloading uses data. Download offline maps to avoid data usage.

**Q: Why does GPS work in some apps but not others?**
A: App permissions. Check each app has location access set to "While Using" or "Always."

**Q: Can I use GPS without cellular service?**
A: Yes, GPS works without cellular. But maps may not load without data. Download offline maps first.

## Conclusion

**Quick fixes:**
1. Toggle Location Services off/on (1 minute)
2. Calibrate compass (2 minutes)
3. Reset Location & Privacy (3 minutes)
4. Restart iPhone (2 minutes)

**Most common causes:**
- Location Services disabled
- App permissions wrong
- Need compass calibration
- Poor GPS signal (indoors)

Most GPS issues are settings or signal-related, not hardware. If GPS works outdoors but not indoors, this is normal GPS behavior. If never works even outdoors with clear sky, check for hardware damage.

**Pro tip:** For navigation, start GPS outside before driving. Initial lock is slower than maintaining lock.
