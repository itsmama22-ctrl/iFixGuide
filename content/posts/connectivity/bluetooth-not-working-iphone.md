- Wireless security cameras

**To reduce interference:**
1. Move away from potential sources
2. Disable Wi-Fi temporarily (test if improves)
3. Turn off other Bluetooth devices nearby
4. Move closer to paired device

**Frequency note:**
- Bluetooth uses 2.4 GHz band
- Same as Wi-Fi and many household devices
- 5 GHz Wi-Fi networks don't interfere

### 10. Check Device Compatibility

Ensure your Bluetooth device works with iPhone.

**Compatibility factors:**
- Bluetooth version support
- iOS version requirements
- Specific device profiles needed

**To check:**
1. Visit manufacturer's website
2. Look for iOS compatibility
3. Check required iOS version
4. Review Bluetooth version requirements

**For older accessories:**

### 11. Restore iPhone

Last resort for persistent Bluetooth issues.

**⚠️ This erases everything. Backup first!**

**To restore:**
1. Backup to iCloud or computer
2. Connect to computer
3. Open iTunes/Finder
4. Select iPhone
5. Click **Restore iPhone**
6. Set up as new device (don't restore backup initially)
7. Test Bluetooth before restoring backup

**If Bluetooth works after fresh restore:**
- Backup likely had corrupted data
- Set up as new or selectively restore data

## Bluetooth-Specific Device Troubleshooting

### AirPods and Wireless Earbuds

**Connection issues:**
1. Put AirPods in case
2. Close lid, wait 30 seconds
3. Open lid near iPhone

- Wait for next beta update
- Or downgrade to stable iOS (requires restore)

### Contact Device Manufacturer

For persistent device-specific issues:
- Visit manufacturer's support site
- Check for firmware updates
- Look for known issues
- Contact their support team

## When It's a Hardware Problem

Sometimes Bluetooth hardware fails.

**Signs of hardware failure:**

- Started after physical damage or water exposure

**Next steps:**
1. Visit Apple Store for diagnostics
2. Contact Apple Support
3. Check warranty coverage
4. May need logic board repair

**Repair costs:**
- Under warranty or AppleCare+: Free or small fee
- Out of warranty: $150-500 depending on repair needed

## Prevention Tips

1. **Keep iOS updated** - Install updates promptly
2. **Regularly restart iPhone** - Once weekly
3. **Manage pairings** - Remove unused devices
4. **Update Bluetooth devices** - Install firmware updates
5. **Keep devices charged** - Low battery causes issues
6. **Avoid excessive heat** - Can damage Bluetooth hardware
7. **Clean charging contacts** - Prevents connection issues

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Why won't my iPhone find my Bluetooth device?**
A: Ensure device is in pairing mode, Bluetooth is on, devices are close together, and device isn't connected to something else. Try forgetting other devices first.

**Q: Why does Bluetooth keep turning off?**
A: Usually a software glitch. Update iOS, reset network settings, or restore iPhone. Rarely indicates hardware failure.

**Q: Can I connect multiple Bluetooth devices at once?**
A: Yes, but behavior depends on device type. You can connect multiple audio output devices, but only one can play audio at a time (unless using audio sharing feature).

**Q: Why is Bluetooth audio quality poor?**
A: Common causes: interference, low battery, distance from device, or poor Bluetooth codec. Use AAC or aptX codecs when possible.

**Q: Does Bluetooth drain battery faster?**
A: Modern Bluetooth (4.0+) uses minimal battery. Impact is usually under 5% per day. If draining significantly more, check for rogue apps or connections.

## Conclusion

Most iPhone Bluetooth issues can be fixed with simple troubleshooting:

**Quick fixes (try first):**
1. Toggle Bluetooth off/on
2. Restart both devices
3. Forget and re-pair
4. Toggle Airplane Mode

**If those don't work:**
5. Reset Network Settings
6. Update iOS
7. Check for interference
8. Restore iPhone

**The most common solutions:**
- Forgetting and re-pairing device (fixes 50%+ of issues)
- Resetting Network Settings
- Updating iOS
- Removing interference sources

Remember:
- Keep iPhone and accessories updated
- Manage paired devices list
- Restart regularly
- Keep devices within range

If you've tried everything and Bluetooth still doesn't work, you likely have a hardware issue. Contact Apple Support or visit an Apple Store for professional diagnostics. Hardware Bluetooth failures are rare but do occur, especially after drops or water exposure.

For device-specific issues (like AirPods, car systems, or fitness trackers), also consult the device manufacturer's support resources—the problem might be with the accessory rather than your iPhone.
