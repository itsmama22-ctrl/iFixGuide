## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Why can't I see the other device in AirDrop?**
A: Both devices need WiFi/Bluetooth on, be within 30 feet, have AirDrop enabled, and receiving device set to "Everyone" or have you in Contacts.

**Q: AirDrop worked before, why not now?**
A: Software update changes, settings changed, or temporary glitch. Restart both devices and check settings.

**Q: Do both devices need to be on same WiFi network?**
A: No, AirDrop creates its own peer-to-peer WiFi connection. But WiFi radio must be on.

**Q: Can I AirDrop to Android?**
A: No, AirDrop is Apple-only. Use Google's Nearby Share or third-party apps like Snapdrop.

**Q: Why does AirDrop sometimes take so long?**
A: Large files, weak signal, interference, or distance. Move closer and retry.

## Conclusion

**Quick fixes (try first):**
1. Set AirDrop to "Everyone" (30 seconds)
2. Verify WiFi/Bluetooth ON (30 seconds)
3. Move devices closer (1 minute)
4. Restart both devices (2 minutes)

**If those don't work:**
5. Disable Personal Hotspot
6. Turn off Do Not Disturb
7. Reset network settings
8. Update iOS

**Most common causes:**
- Wrong AirDrop setting (not on "Everyone")
- WiFi or Bluetooth off
- Too far apart
- Hotspot interfering
- Do Not Disturb blocking

90% of AirDrop issues fix with correct settings and restarting devices. If problems persist after all troubleshooting, likely hardware or enterprise restriction issue.

**Pro tip:** For troubleshooting, always set to "Everyone" mode temporarily—even if you normally use "Contacts Only" for privacy.
