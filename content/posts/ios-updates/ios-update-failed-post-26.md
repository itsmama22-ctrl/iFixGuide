Update failures prevent you from getting latest iOS. This guide fixes all update error messages and failures.

## Common Update Errors
- Software Update Failed
- Installation Error
- Unable to Install
- Verification Failed
- Update Corrupted

## Quick Fixes

### 1. Free Up Storage
Settings > General > iPhone Storage. Need 5-10GB free for major updates. Delete apps/photos.

### 2. Check WiFi Connection
Need stable WiFi. Restart router, move closer, or try different network.

### 3. Delete and Re-download Update
Settings > General > iPhone Storage > iOS Update > Delete. Then re-download fresh.

### 4. Charge iPhone
Need 50%+ battery or plugged in. Connect to charger during update.

### 5. Restart iPhone
Force restart: Volume Up, Down, hold Side. Then try updating again.

### 6. Update via Computer
Connect to Mac/PC. iTunes/Finder > Check for Update > Download and Update. More reliable.

### 7. Check Apple Servers
Visit apple.com/support/systemstatus. If servers down, wait and retry later.

### 8. Disable VPN
Settings > VPN > OFF. VPN interferes with update downloads.

### 9. Reset Network Settings
Settings > General > Transfer or Reset > Reset > Reset Network Settings.

### 10. Recovery Mode Update
Last resort. Connect to computer, enter Recovery Mode, select Update (preserves data).

## Conclusion
Most update failures due to insufficient storage or poor WiFi. Free up 10GB space and use stable WiFi for best results. Update via computer if over-the-air fails.
