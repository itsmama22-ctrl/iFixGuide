When your iPhone microphone stops working, people can't hear you during calls, voice memos fail, and Siri won't respond. This guide covers all solutions to fix microphone issues.

## Types of Microphone Problems

- People can't hear you during phone calls
- Voice memos record no sound
- Siri doesn't respond to "Hey Siri"
- Video recordings have no audio
- FaceTime/Zoom participants can't hear you
- Microphone sounds muffled or distorted

## iPhone Has Multiple Microphones

**Location of mics:**
- **Bottom mic:** Near charging port (primary for calls)
- **Front mic:** Near front camera (FaceTime, video)
- **Back mic:** Near rear camera (video recording)

**Test each separately** to identify which is failing.

## 10 Solutions to Fix iPhone Microphone

### 1. Remove Case and Screen Protector

Cases can block microphone openings.

**Steps:**
1. Remove iPhone case completely
2. Check if screen protector covers front mic
3. Make test call without accessories
4. If works, case/protector is culprit

**Get case with proper cutouts.**

### 2. Clean Microphone Openings

Dirt blocks sound.

**Cleaning method:**
1. Use soft-bristled toothbrush
2. Gently brush mic grilles
3. Use compressed air at angle
4. Don't insert anything into openings
5. Blow out debris

**Microphone locations:**
- Bottom of iPhone (both sides of charging port)
- Front near earpiece
- Back near camera

### 3. Test in Different Apps

Identify if app-specific or system-wide.

**Test calls:**
- Regular phone call
- FaceTime audio
- Voice Memos app
- Camera video recording
- WhatsApp/Zoom call

**If one works:**
- Problem is app-specific
- Check app permissions
- Update or reinstall problem app

### 4. Check Microphone Permissions

Apps need permission to access mic.

**To check:**

2. Ensure apps have access enabled
3. Toggle off and back on

**Enable for:**
- Phone
- FaceTime

### 5. Disable Noise Cancellation

Feature can cause mic issues.

**To disable:**

2. Scroll to **Phone Noise Cancellation**
3. Toggle **OFF**
4. Test calls

**Try with it off and on** to see which works better.

### 6. Disconnect Bluetooth Devices

Audio routing to Bluetooth can seem like mic failure.

**Steps:**
1. **Settings** > **Bluetooth**
2. Disconnect all devices
3. Or toggle Bluetooth off
4. Make test call

**Check during calls:**
- Tap speaker icon
- Ensure routing to iPhone, not Bluetooth
