When your iPhone won't turn on, it can be alarming. Whether the screen stays black, you see the Apple logo but nothing else, or there's no sign of life at all, this guide will help you troubleshoot and fix the problem.

## Why Won't Your iPhone Turn On?

**Common causes:**
- Completely drained battery
- Software crash
- Failed iOS update
- Physical or water damage
- Hardware failure
- Charging port issues
- Display failure (iPhone is on, but screen is black)

## 10 Solutions to Fix iPhone That Won't Turn On

### 1. Charge Your iPhone

Most "dead" iPhones just have drained batteries.

**Proper charging:**
1. Use original Apple charger or certified alternative
2. Plug directly into wall outlet (not computer USB)
3. Wait at least 15-30 minutes before trying to turn on
4. Look for charging indicator on screen

**If completely drained:**
- May take 5-10 minutes before charging icon appears
- Leave charging for 30 minutes minimum
- Don't try to turn on immediately

**Check charging:**
- Lightning/USB-C cable clicks in securely
- Charging icon appears on screen
- iPhone feels slightly warm (normal when charging)

### 2. Inspect Charging Cable and Adapter

Faulty accessories prevent charging.

**Check cable:**
- Look for fraying or damage
- Connector pins not bent
- Try different cable
- Use original Apple cable if possible

**Check adapter:**
- Ensure prongs not bent
- Try different outlet
- Use 20W or higher adapter
- Test adapter with different cable

**Test method:**
- Try charging another device with same setup
- Try known-working charger with your iPhone

### 3. Force Restart Your iPhone

Fixes software crashes and frozen systems.

**iPhone 8 and newer:**
1. Press and release Volume Up
2. Press and release Volume Down
3. Hold Side button for 10-15 seconds
4. Keep holding even if you see Apple logo initially
5. Release when you see Apple logo again

**iPhone 7:**
1. Hold Volume Down + Sleep/Wake simultaneously
2. Keep holding 10-15 seconds until Apple logo

**iPhone 6s and earlier:**
1. Hold Home + Sleep/Wake together
2. Continue for 10-15 seconds until Apple logo

**Important:** Keep buttons pressed even if you initially see Apple logo - this ensures complete restart.

### 4. Clean Charging Port

Debris prevents proper connection.

**Cleaning method:**
1. Turn off iPhone (if possible)
2. Use flashlight to inspect port
3. Use wooden toothpick or plastic pick
4. Gently scrape out lint and debris
5. Blow out loosened particles
6. Don't insert metal objects
7. Don't use excessive force

**Common debris:**
- Pocket lint (most common)
- Dust accumulation
- Small particles

**After cleaning:**
- Try charging again
- Cable should click in more securely

### 5. Check for Physical Damage

Drops or water exposure can prevent power-on.

**Inspect for:**
- Cracked screen
- Dents or bends in frame
- Water damage indicators (red dots in SIM tray)
- Swollen battery (back bulging)
- Separated screen or back glass

**Water damage:**
- Red liquid contact indicators
- If recently wet, let dry 24-48 hours
- Don't try to charge wet iPhone
- Don't use rice (ineffective)
- Use silica gel packets if available

**If physically damaged:**
- Contact Apple Support
- May need professional repair
- Check warranty or AppleCare+ coverage

### 6. Try DFU Mode Recovery

Deep recovery for serious software issues.

**⚠️ WARNING: May erase data if restore required. Try Update first.**

**Enter DFU Mode:**

**iPhone 8 and newer:**
1. Connect to computer with iTunes/Finder open
2. Press and release Volume Up
3. Press and release Volume Down
4. Hold Side button for 10 seconds
5. While still holding Side, also press and hold Volume Down
6. After 5 seconds, release Side but keep holding Volume Down for 5 more seconds
7. Screen stays completely black if successful
8. Computer shows recovery message

**Then:**
- Select **Update** (preserves data)
- Wait for process to complete
- If Update fails, may need to Restore (erases data)

### 7. Put in Recovery Mode

Easier than DFU, try this first.

**iPhone 8 and newer:**
1. Connect to computer
2. Quick press Volume Up
3. Quick press Volume Down
4. Hold Side button until recovery screen appears (cable and computer icon)

**iPhone 7:**
1. Connect to computer
2. Hold Volume Down + Side button
3. Keep holding until recovery screen

**iPhone 6s and earlier:**
1. Connect to computer
2. Hold Home + Power
3. Continue until recovery screen

**On computer:**
- Click **Update** to preserve data
- Click **Restore** only if Update fails (erases everything)

### 8. Let Battery Drain and Recharge

For frozen iPhone that won't respond.

**Steps:**
1. Leave iPhone alone until battery fully drains
2. This can take hours or even days
3. Once dead, charge for 1 hour
4. Try force restart
5. Try turning on normally

**When to use:**
- Other methods failed
- iPhone is warm (indicates something running)
- Have time to wait

### 9. Check Display vs. Power

iPhone might be on but display is dead.

**Test if iPhone is actually on:**
- Listen for notification sounds
- Call your iPhone from another phone
- Connect to computer and see if iTunes/Finder recognizes it
- Press Side button and listen for vibration

**If iPhone responds but screen is black:**
- Display issue, not power issue
- May need screen repair
- Contact Apple Support

### 10. Try Different Charging Method

Test all available charging options.

**Methods to try:**
- Wall outlet charging (best)
- Computer USB port
- Wireless charging (iPhone 8 and newer)

- Power bank
- Different cable and adapter combination

**If one method works:**
- Problem with original charger/cable
