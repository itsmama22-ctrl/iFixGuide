Specific screen areas not responding indicates dead zones. This guide fixes partial screen unresponsiveness.

## Fixes for Dead Screen Zones

### 1. Clean Screen Thoroughly
Dirt can create dead zones. Clean with microfiber cloth, slight moisture if needed.

### 2. Remove Screen Protector
Protectors can create non-responsive areas. Remove and test.

### 3. Force Restart
Volume Up, Down, hold Side button. Fixes software-related dead zones.

### 4. Calibrate Screen
Settings > Accessibility > Touch > 3D Touch (if available) > adjust sensitivity.

### 5. Update iOS
Settings > General > Software Update. Touch screen fixes in updates.

### 6. Reset All Settings
Settings > General > Transfer or Reset > Reset > Reset All Settings.

### 7. Test in Safe Mode
Restart and don't open third-party apps. If works, app causing issue.

### 8. Check for Physical Damage
Cracks, water damage, or drop damage can create dead zones. Needs display replacement.

## When Hardware Issue

**If software fixes don't work:**
- Likely display digitizer damage
- Needs screen replacement
- Apple: \$150-400 depending on model
- Check warranty/AppleCare+

## Conclusion
Clean screen and remove protector first. If dead zone persists after restart and software fixes, likely hardware damage requiring screen replacement.
