Dropping your iPhone in water is panic-inducing. Quick action can save your device. This guide covers everything to do immediately and how to maximize chances of recovery.

## Immediate Actions (First 5 Minutes Critical)

### 1. Remove from Water IMMEDIATELY

**Every second counts:**
- Grab iPhone instantly
- Don't wait to finish what you're doing
- The longer submerged, the worse the damage

### 2. Turn OFF iPhone Right Away

**Critical step:**
1. Hold Side button + Volume Down
2. Slide to power off
3. If already off, **don't turn it on**
4. **Never try to charge** wet iPhone

**Why turn off:**
- Prevents short circuits
- Stops current flow through wet components
- Maximizes salvage chances

### 3. Remove Case and Accessories

**Take off everything:**
- Phone case
- Screen protector (if loose)
- SIM card tray
- Any cables
- AirPods from case

**Dry each item separately.**

### 4. Wipe Exterior Dry

**Use absorbent material:**
- Microfiber cloth best
- Lint-free towel
- Paper towels acceptable
- Gentle patting, not rubbing

**Dry all ports:**
- Lightning/USB-C port
- Speaker grilles  
- Microphone holes
- Headphone jack (older models)

### 5. Position to Drain

**Optimal positioning:**
- Stand iPhone upright
- Ports facing down
- Lets water drain out
- Don't shake vigorously

## What NOT to Do (Critical)

### ❌ Don't Use Heat

**Never:**
- Hair dryer
- Oven
- Microwave
- Direct sunlight
- Radiator
- Any heat source

**Why:**
- Heat damages components
- Warps internal parts
- Makes worse

### ❌ Don't Use Rice

**Rice is a myth:**
- Doesn't absorb water effectively
- Dust gets into ports
- Delays proper drying
- Waste of time

**Better alternatives:**
- Silica gel packets
- Professional drying
- Air drying in controlled environment

### ❌ Don't Charge

**Never plug in wet iPhone:**
- Causes short circuits
- Permanent damage
- Fire risk
- Wait minimum 24-48 hours

### ❌ Don't Turn On

**Resist urge to test:**
- "Just checking" ruins phones
- Water + electricity = dead iPhone
- Wait full drying period

## How to Dry iPhone Properly

### Best Method: Silica Gel

**If you have silica gel packets:**
1. Gather many packets
2. Place iPhone in airtight container
3. Surround with silica gel
4. Seal container
5. Wait 48-72 hours

**Where to get:**
- Craft stores
- Amazon
- Pet stores (cat litter crystals)

### Alternative: Air Drying

**If no silica gel:**
1. Find dry, warm (not hot) location
2. Good air circulation
3. Stand iPhone upright
4. Place on absorbent surface
5. Wait 48-72 hours minimum

**Good locations:**
- Dry room with dehumidifier
- Near (not on) electronics that generate warmth
- Well-ventilated area

### Professional Drying

**Best option:**
- Take to phone repair shop
- They have ultrasonic cleaners
- Professional drying chambers
- Can disassemble and dry properly
- Best chance of full recovery

**Cost:**
- $50-150 for professional drying
- Worth it for expensive iPhones

## How Long to Wait

### Minimum Drying Time

**Light splash:**
- 24 hours minimum
- Better safe than sorry

**Brief submersion (< 30 seconds):**
- 48 hours recommended

**Full submersion (> 30 seconds):**
- 72 hours minimum
- Consider professional service

**Salt water or dirty water:**
- 72+ hours
- Professional cleaning highly recommended
- Salt/minerals cause corrosion

### When to Test

**After drying period:**
1. Visually inspect ports for moisture
2. Feel for any dampness
3. If completely dry, try turning on
4. If any moisture, wait longer

## Testing After Drying

### First Power-On

**Careful steps:**
1. Ensure 100% dry
2. Press and hold Side button
3. Watch for Apple logo
4. Let boot completely

**Good signs:**
- Boots normally
- Screen works
- Touch responsive
- No weird noises

**Bad signs:**
- Won't turn on
- Screen artifacts
- Crackling sounds
- Functions not working

### Component Testing

**Test everything:**
- ☑️ Touch screen all areas
- ☑️ Speakers and microphone
- ☑️ Cameras (front and back)
- ☑️ Buttons (all of them)
- ☑️ Face ID/Touch ID
- ☑️ Charging
- ☑️ WiFi and Bluetooth
- ☑️ Cellular connection

**Document issues** for repair shop if needed.

## Water Resistance vs Waterproof

### iPhone Water Resistance Ratings

**IP67 (iPhone 7-X/XR):**
- 1 meter for 30 minutes
- Fresh water only

**IP68 (iPhone XS and newer):**
- iPhone 12-15 Pro Max: 6 meters for 30 minutes
- iPhone XS-11: 2-4 meters for 30 minutes

**Important:**
- Water resistance degrades over time
- Ratings are for new phones only
- Not tested for salt water, chlorine, etc.
- **Not a guarantee** - just resistance

### What Voids Water Resistance

- Drops and impacts
- Screen repairs
- Age (adhesive degrades)
- Previous water exposure
- Worn seals

## Signs of Water Damage

### Liquid Contact Indicators

**Check for red dots:**
- SIM tray slot
- Charging port
- Inside speaker grilles

**White/silver = no liquid**
**Red = liquid contact**

### Symptoms of Water Damage

**Immediate:**
- Won't turn on
- Screen flickering
- No sound
- Buttons not working

**Delayed (days/weeks later):**
- Corrosion damage
- Battery issues
- Random shutdowns
- Connectivity problems
- Camera fog

## Repair Options and Costs

### AppleCare+ Coverage

**If you have AppleCare+:**
- $99 service fee
- Covers accidental damage
- Includes water damage
- May replace entire phone

**Without AppleCare+:**
- Out-of-warranty replacement
- $329-$579 depending on model
- Usually cheaper than new iPhone

### Third-Party Repair

**What they can do:**
- Clean corrosion
- Replace damaged components
- Test all functions
- Sometimes save phone

**Costs:**
- Cleaning: $50-100
- Component replacement: $100-300
- Full recovery varies

### DIY Repair (Not Recommended)

- Requires disassembly
- Special tools needed
- Easy to cause more damage
- Voids any remaining warranty

## Prevention Tips

### Protective Measures

**Before water exposure:**
1. **Waterproof case** for beach/pool
2. **Lanyard** prevents drops
3. **Zip-lock bag** simple waterproofing
4. **Screen protector** adds barrier
5. **Insurance** or AppleCare+

- Use Bluetooth speaker instead
- Zippered pocket

**Pool/Beach:**
- Waterproof case mandatory
- Leave in bag when not needed
- Rinse if exposed to salt/chlorine

**Rain:**
- Pockets can leak
- Use umbrella
- Waterproof bag

**Spills:**
- Keep drinks away from iPhone
- Use coaster/mat
- Immediate cleanup

## When to Give Up

### Unrecoverable Signs

**Phone is likely dead if:**
- Still won't turn on after 1 week drying
- Severe corrosion visible
- Multiple components failed
- Repair cost exceeds replacement value

**Consider:**
- Trade-in value (even broken)
- Data recovery services ($300-2000)
- Upgrade to new iPhone

## Data Recovery

### If iPhone Won't Turn On

**Recovery options:**
1. **iCloud backup** (if enabled)
   - Most data recoverable
   - Restore to new iPhone

2. **Professional data recovery**
   - $300-$2000
   - Not guaranteed
   - For critical data only

3. **Component-level repair**
   - Specialized shops
   - Expensive
   - Last resort

### Backup Importance

**Always backup:**
- Enable iCloud Backup
- Backup to computer regularly
- Most data survives phone death

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Can rice really save a wet iPhone?**
A: No, rice is ineffective. Use silica gel or professional drying. Rice is a myth that wastes critical drying time.

**Q: How long until I know if my iPhone survived?**
A: After 48-72 hours of drying, if it powers on and works normally, good chance of survival. But corrosion can appear weeks later.

**Q: Will Apple fix water damage?**
A: Apple doesn't "repair" water damage, they replace the phone. With AppleCare+: $99. Without: $329-579.

**Q: Is iPhone waterproof?**
A: No, only water-resistant. This degrades over time and isn't foolproof. Never intentionally submerge.

**Q: Should I try to charge my wet iPhone?**
A: Absolutely not. Wait minimum 48 hours after thorough drying. Charging wet phone causes short circuits.

## Success Stories vs Reality

**Truth about water damage:**
- **Immediate action** determines outcome
- **Fresh water, brief exposure**: 60-70% recovery rate
- **Salt water, long exposure**: 20-30% recovery rate
- **Proper drying**: Makes or breaks recovery
- **Turning on too soon**: #1 cause of permanent damage

## Conclusion

**Critical steps for best chance:**
1. Remove from water immediately (seconds matter)
2. Power OFF instantly
3. Don't use heat or rice
4. Dry properly for 48-72 hours minimum
5. Test carefully after completely dry
6. Consider professional service

**Reality check:**
- Not all wet iPhones can be saved
- Quick action helps tremendously
- Professional drying is best
- Prevention better than cure

**Your next steps:**
- Power off (if not already)
- Begin proper drying NOW
- Consider professional service
- Plan for backup/replacement if needed

Most important: **Don't turn it on** until completely certain it's dry. More phones are killed by impatient owners than by the water itself.
