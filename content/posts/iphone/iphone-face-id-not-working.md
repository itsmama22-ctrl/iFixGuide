Face ID makes unlocking your iPhone effortlessâ€”when it works. If Face ID stopped recognizing you, shows "Face ID is not available," or keeps failing, this guide has the solutions.

## Common Face ID Problems

- "Face ID is not available"
- Face ID not recognizing your face
- Setup fails with "Face not detected"
- Works sometimes but not consistently
- Stopped working after iOS update
- Authentication fails repeatedly

## Why Face ID Stops Working

**Common causes:**
- Obstructed TrueDepth camera
- Poor lighting conditions
- Drastic appearance changes
- Software glitches
- Screen protector interference
- Hardware damage

## 11 Solutions to Fix Face ID

### 1. Clean TrueDepth Camera

Dirt blocks sensors.

**Cleaning method:**
1. Turn off iPhone
2. Use clean, dry microfiber cloth
3. Gently wipe notch area
4. Clean front camera, sensors, and speaker
5. No liquids or cleaners

**TrueDepth sensors are in the notch/Dynamic Island.**

### 2. Remove Face Obstructions

Face ID needs clear view of your face.

**Check for:**
- Face masks
- Scarves covering face
- Sunglasses
- Hats covering forehead
- Hair covering face
- Hand blocking camera

**Face ID with mask:**
- iPhone 12 and newer with iOS 15.4+
- Must set up "Face ID with a Mask"
- Works with Apple Watch as backup

### 3. Ensure Proper Lighting

Too dark or too bright affects Face ID.

**Tips:**
- Need adequate lighting
- Avoid direct sunlight on face
- Don't use in complete darkness
- Indoor/outdoor lighting usually fine

**If fails in poor light:**
- Move to better lit area
- Use as intended - Face ID adapts

### 4. Re-Position iPhone

Angle and distance matter.

**Optimal positioning:**
- 10-20 inches from face
- At eye level
- Point directly at face
- Don't tilt too much

**Eye contact required:**
- Look directly at iPhone
- Must have eyes open
- Attention awareness on by default

### 5. Reset Face ID

Clear and re-register your face.

**Steps:**
1. **Settings** > **Face ID & Passcode**
2. Enter passcode
3. **Reset Face ID**
4. **Set Up Face ID**
5. Follow on-screen instructions
6. Register face in good lighting

**Tips for setup:**
- Remove glasses first, add as alternate appearance later
- Good even lighting
- Hair away from face
- Complete full circle motion

### 6. Add Alternate Appearance

For glasses, makeup, facial hair changes.

**Steps:**
1. **Settings** > **Face ID & Passcode**
2. **Set Up an Alternate Appearance**
3. Register face with different look

**Use for:**
- With/without glasses
- With/without makeup

- After significant weight change

### 7. Disable Require Attention

Makes Face ID less strict.

**Steps:**
1. **Settings** > **Face ID & Passcode**
2. Toggle OFF **Require Attention for Face ID**

**Effect:**
- Doesn't require direct eye contact
- Slightly less secure
- Works with eyes closed
- Good for accessibility

### 8. Restart iPhone

Clears software glitches.

**Force restart:**
- **iPhone X and newer:** Volume Up, Volume Down, hold Side button until Apple logo

**After restart:**
- Try Face ID
- Re-enable if was disabled

1. **Settings** > **General** > **Software Update**
2. Install available updates
3. WiFi and charging required

- TrueDepth camera issues
- Performance improvements

### 10. Check for Screen Protector Issues

Some protectors interfere with sensors.

**Test:**
1. Temporarily remove screen protector
2. Try Face ID
3. If works, protector is problem

**If screen protector is issue:**
- Get one with precise cutout for notch
- Avoid thick glass protectors
- Or use none on notch area

### 11. Reset All Settings

Fixes corrupted Face ID settings.

**Steps:**
1. **Settings** > **General** > **Transfer or Reset iPhone**
2. **Reset** > **Reset All Settings**
3. Enter passcode
4. Doesn't delete data

**After reset:**

## "Face ID is not available" Error

3. If persists, restart iPhone
4. Reset Face ID
5. Update iOS

**If error persists:**
- May be hardware issue

## Face ID Fails Intermittently

## When It's Hardware Damage

**Hardware failure signs:**

## Face ID vs Touch ID

**If Face ID doesn't work well for you:**

- Or use passcode
- No alternative on Face ID-only iPhones

## Face ID in Different Scenarios

**Wearing glasses:**

- Add as alternate appearance if issues
- Sunglasses may not work

**Significant weight change:**
- Face ID adapts gradually
- Extreme change may need reset
- Add new appearance

**After surgery/injury:**
- May need to reset Face ID
- Wait for healing if temporary

**With hat/beanie:**
- Usually works
- Depends on coverage

## Privacy and Security

**Face ID security:**
- More secure than Touch ID
- 1 in 1,000,000 chance of false match
- Data stays on iPhone (not sent to Apple)
- Requires attention by default

**When Face ID disabled:**
- After 5 failed attempts
- After 48 hours without use
- After restart
- After remote lock
- Safety feature prevents forced unlock

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Why does Face ID work for my sibling/twin?**
A: Identical twins or close relatives may unlock device. Face ID is 1 in 1,000,000 for general population but less secure for identical twins.

**Q: Can Face ID work in complete darkness?**
A: Yes, uses infrared - works in total darkness. Visible light not required.

**Q: Will Face ID work if I grow a beard?**
A: Usually yes. Face ID adapts to gradual changes. Extreme sudden change may require adding alternate appearance.

**Q: Can I have multiple faces for Face ID?**
A: One primary face + one alternate appearance. Both can unlock iPhone.

**Q: Does Face ID work with eyes closed?**
A: Not by default (Require Attention must be on). Can disable attention requirement for accessibility, but less secure.

## Conclusion

**Quick fixes (try first):**
1. Clean TrueDepth camera (1 minute)
2. Remove face coverings (30 seconds)
3. Restart iPhone (2 minutes)
4. Reset Face ID and re-register (3 minutes)

**If those don't work:**
5. Add alternate appearance
6. Disable Require Attention
7. Update iOS
8. Reset all settings

**Most common causes:**
- Dirty camera (40%)
- Face partially covered (25%)
- Poor lighting (15%)
- Need to reset Face ID (10%)
- Hardware damage (10%)

Most Face ID issues fix with cleaning, re-registering, or adjusting usage. If "Face ID is not available" persists after all troubleshooting, likely hardware damage requiring professional repair.

**Pro tip:** Register Face ID in same conditions you'll typically use it (with glasses if you wear them, typical hairstyle, etc.).
