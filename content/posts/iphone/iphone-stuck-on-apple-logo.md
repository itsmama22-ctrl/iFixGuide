iPhone stuck on Apple logo indicates boot failure. This guide provides solutions to get past the logo and boot normally.

## 8 Fixes for Apple Logo Stuck

### 1. Force Restart
Volume Up, Down, hold Side button 10+ seconds. Keep holding even if logo appears. Release only when logo appears AGAIN.

### 2. Charge for 30 Minutes
Battery may be too low. Charge 30-60 minutes then force restart while plugged in.

### 3. Update via Recovery Mode
Connect to computer > enter Recovery Mode > Select Update (preserves data).

### 4. Check for Storage Issues
If boots briefly, may be storage full causing crash. Restore and selectively restore data.

### 5. DFU Mode Restore
Deep restore. Erases everything but often fixes. Backup first if possible.

### 6. Check for Water Damage
Red indicators mean water damage. May need professional cleaning or repair.

### 7. Try Different Cable
Connect to computer with known-good cable. Bad cable prevents computer connection.

### 8. Professional Diagnosis
If nothing works, hardware issue. Apple Store can diagnose specific component failure.

## Conclusion
Most Apple logo stuck issues fix with force restart or Recovery Mode update. If neither works, likely hardware failure requiring professional repair.
