### 5. Check Face ID Settings

Ensure Face ID is properly configured:

3. **Verify** Face ID is enabled
4. **Check** that your face is registered
5. **Enable** Face ID for the features you want

4. **Test** if Face ID makes any attempt to scan

### 8. Test in Different Lighting Conditions

Face ID works best in good lighting:

2. **Try** in different indoor lighting conditions

4. **Enter** your passcode and Apple ID password

## Advanced Troubleshooting

### Test with Different Faces

Determine if the issue is face-specific:

1. **Ask** someone else to try Face ID
2. **Register** a different person's face temporarily
3. **Test** if their face is recognized
4. **If other faces work**, the issue is with your face registration
5. **If no faces work**, the issue is hardware-related

### Check Privacy Settings

5. **Adjust** settings as needed
