Night mode captures amazing low-light photos. When unavailable or not working, this guide fixes it.

## 7 Fixes for Night Mode

### 1. Ensure Sufficient Darkness
Night mode only activates in low light. Won't work in bright light - this is normal.

### 2. Hold iPhone Steady
Requires 1-3 seconds exposure. Keep very still or use tripod. Movement cancels Night mode.

### 3. Check iPhone Model
Requires iPhone 11 or newer. iPhone X and earlier don't have Night mode.

### 4. Update iOS
Settings > General > Software Update. Night mode improvements in updates.

### 5. Enable Auto Night Mode
Camera > tap Night mode icon. Set to Auto (yellow) not Off.

### 6. Restart Camera App
Close and reopen Camera app. Resets Night mode detection.

### 7. Restart iPhone
Force restart: Volume Up, Down, hold Side button.

## Using Night Mode Properly
- Appears automatically in low light
- Shows 1-3 second timer
- Keep iPhone steady during capture
- Can adjust exposure time
- Works with wide and telephoto lenses

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Why won't Night mode turn on?**
A: Either not dark enough, or iPhone X and earlier (doesn't have Night mode).

**Q: Can I use Night mode in daylight?**
A: No, only activates in low light. Use regular photo mode in bright light.

**Q: Why are Night mode photos blurry?**
A: Movement during 1-3 second exposure. Hold very still or use tripod.

## Conclusion
Night mode requires iPhone 11+, low light conditions, and steady hands. Most issues are user error - ensure truly dark environment and hold very still.
