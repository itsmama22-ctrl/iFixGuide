Portrait mode creates beautiful photos with blurred backgrounds. When it stops working or becomes unavailable, this guide has the solutions.

## Common Portrait Mode Issues

- Portrait mode greyed out/unavailable
- Background blur not working
- "Move farther away" constant message
- Depth effect not applying
- Portrait mode photos look normal
- Works with one lens but not others

## Why Portrait Mode Doesn't Work

**Common reasons:**
- Subject too close or too far
- Insufficient lighting
- No clear subject detected
- Software glitches
- Incompatible subject
- Camera hardware issues

## Portrait Mode Requirements

**Needs:**
- Compatible iPhone (7 Plus, 8 Plus, X and newer)
- Dual cameras or LiDAR (depending on model)
- Subject 2-8 feet away
- Adequate lighting
- Clear subject (person, pet, or object)

## 8 Solutions to Fix Portrait Mode

### 1. Check Distance from Subject

Most common issue.

**Optimal distance:**
- 2-8 feet from subject
- Not too close (under 2 feet won't work)
- Not too far (over 8 feet reduces effect)

**If message says:**
- **"Move farther away":** Step back
- **"Move closer":** Step forward
- Follow on-screen guidance

### 2. Improve Lighting

Portrait mode needs good light.

**Requirements:**
- Adequate lighting on subject
- Not too dark (won't activate)
- Avoid very bright backlighting

**Best lighting:**
- Natural outdoor light
- Well-lit indoor
- Avoid direct harsh shadows

**If too dark:**
- Move to brighter area
- Use additional lighting
- Or use regular photo mode

### 3. Ensure Clear Subject

Portrait mode needs to identify subject.

**Works best with:**
- People (faces detected)
- Pets (clear outline)
- Objects with defined edges

**Doesn't work well with:**
- Flat walls
- Sky
- Complex scenes
- No clear subject

**Frame subject clearly** against distinct background.

### 4. Restart Camera App

Refresh Portrait mode.

**Steps:**
1. Swipe up from bottom
2. Close Camera app
3. Wait 10 seconds
4. Reopen
5. Try Portrait mode

### 5. Restart iPhone

Clears camera glitches.

**Force restart:**
- iPhone 8+: Volume Up, Down, hold Side button
- iPhone 7: Hold Volume Down + Power
- iPhone 6s: Hold Home + Power

**After restart, test Portrait mode.**

### 6. Update iOS

Portrait mode improvements.

**To update:**
1. **Settings** > **General** > **Software Update**
2. Install available updates
3. Camera enhancements often included

### 7. Reset Camera Settings

Return to defaults.

**Steps:**
1. **Settings** > **Camera**
2. Note your preferences
3. **Settings** > **General** > **Transfer or Reset iPhone**
4. **Reset** > **Reset All Settings**
5. Doesn't delete photos

**Reconfigure camera preferences after reset.**

### 8. Test Different Camera Lenses

If multiple lenses available.

**Try:**
- 1x lens (most reliable)
- 2x lens (if available)
- 3x lens (if available)

**If one lens works:**
- Other lens may have issue
- Use working lens for Portrait

## Portrait Mode Lighting Effects

**If Portrait works but lighting effects don't:**

**Check:**
- Lighting effects need iPhone 8 Plus, X, or newer
- Good subject lighting required
- Tap lighting icon in Camera
- Choose different effect

**Available effects:**
- Natural Light
- Studio Light
- Contour Light
- Stage Light
- Stage Light Mono
- High-Key Light Mono

## Editing Portrait Photos

**Can add/remove blur after taking photo:**

1. Open photo in Photos app
2. Tap **Edit**
3. Tap **Portrait** button
4. Adjust depth slider
5. Can disable Portrait effect entirely

- iPhone 12 and newer
- Some photos can have Portrait added in editing

## Device-Specific Issues

**iPhone 7 Plus/8 Plus:**
- Requires dual cameras
- Only works with telephoto lens
- Subject must be in frame properly

**iPhone XR/11:**
- Works with single camera (for people only)
- Uses AI depth estimation
- Less accurate than dual-camera models

**iPhone 12 and newer:**
- LiDAR for better depth
- Works in lower light
- More accurate blur

## When It's Hardware

**Hardware failure signs:**
- Portrait never works
- Works with one lens not others
- Started after drop/damage
- Camera otherwise malfunctions

**Next steps:**
- Test regular photo mode
- If camera works but not Portrait, likely software
- If camera has other issues too, may be hardware

## Alternatives to Portrait Mode

**Third-party apps:**
- Focos
- Halide
- ProCamera
- Can create depth effect

**Edit after:**
- Snapseed
- Lightroom Mobile

## Prevention Tips

2. **Use in good lighting**
3. **Keep camera lens clean**
4. **Update iOS regularly**
5. **Frame subject clearly**

## Conclusion

**Quick fixes:**
1. Check distance (2-8 feet) - 30 seconds
2. Ensure good lighting - 1 minute
3. Restart Camera app - 30 seconds
4. Restart iPhone - 2 minutes

**Most common causes:**
- Subject too close/far (50%)
- Insufficient lighting (30%)
- No clear subject detected (15%)
- Software glitches (5%)

Portrait mode is picky about conditions. Most "not working" issues are positioning and lighting, not defects. Follow requirements for distance, lighting, and clear subject for best results.

**Pro tip:** For best Portrait mode results, place subject 4-5 feet away with good lighting and distinct background separation.
