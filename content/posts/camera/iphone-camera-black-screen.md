Opening your iPhone camera only to see a black screen is frustrating, especially when you need to capture an important moment. This guide explains why your camera shows a black screen and provides 12 effective solutions.

## Why Does iPhone Camera Show Black Screen?

**Common causes:**

- Third-party camera apps also show black
- Front camera works but back doesn't (or vice versa)

## 12 Solutions to Fix Camera Black Screen

### 1. Remove Case and Clean Lens

Physical obstruction is surprisingly common.

**Remove iPhone case:**

- Screen protector covering lens

### 2. Force Close Camera App

App might be frozen or crashed.

**To force close:**
1. Swipe up from bottom (or double-click Home)
2. Find Camera app card
3. Swipe up on it to close
4. Wait 5-10 seconds
5. Open Camera from home screen

**Alternative method:**
1. Open Settings
2. Don't see camera in background apps
3. Just restart iPhone (next step)

### 3. Restart Your iPhone

Fresh start resolves most software glitches.

**Force restart:**

**iPhone 8 and newer:**
1. Quick press Volume Up
2. Quick press Volume Down
3. Hold Side button until Apple logo

**iPhone 7:**
1. Hold Volume Down + Power simultaneously

**iPhone 6s and earlier:**
1. Hold Home + Power together
2. Continue until Apple logo shows

**After restart:**

### 3. Switch Between Cameras

Sometimes switching unsticks the camera.

**In Camera app:**
1. Tap flip camera icon (circular arrows)
2. Switch from back to front camera
3. Then switch back
4. Try zoom levels (0.5x, 1x, 2x, etc.)
5. Test each lens individually

**If one camera works:**
- Other camera may have hardware issue
- Continue troubleshooting
- May need professional repair

### 5. Check Camera Restrictions

Screen Time or restrictions might block camera.

**Check restrictions:**
1. Go to **Settings** > **Screen Time**
2. Tap **Content & Privacy Restrictions**
3. Tap **Allowed Apps**
4. Ensure **Camera** is enabled (green toggle)

**If Camera is disabled:**
- Toggle it on

2. Immediately after restart, don't open any third-party apps
3. Open only Camera app
4. Test if camera works

**If camera works:**
- Third-party app causing conflict

- Or restore iPhone

### 11. Check for Physical Damage

Hardware issues need professional repair.

**Inspect camera:**
- Look at lens for cracks
- Check for scratches on lens cover
- Look for moisture or fog inside lens

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Why does my camera work sometimes but not others?**
A: Usually a software glitch, app conflict, or loose hardware connection. Update iOS, close conflicting apps, or visit Apple Store if persists.

**Q: Can I fix camera hardware issues myself?**
A: Not recommended. iPhone cameras are complex and repairs require specialized tools. DIY repairs often cause more damage and void warranty.

**Q: Why did my camera stop working after iOS update?**
A: Sometimes updates have bugs. Wait for patch update, or try resetting all settings. If widespread issue, Apple releases fix quickly.

**Q: Does Apple replace cameras for free?**
A: Only if under warranty and not due to accidental damage. AppleCare+ covers accidents with service fee ($29-99).

**Q: How do I know if it's software or hardware?**
A: If camera works after restart but fails later, likely software. If never works despite all troubleshooting, likely hardware.

Remember: Always try software fixes before assuming hardware failure. Over 80% of camera issues are software-related and fixable at home.

If you've tried all solutions and camera still shows black screen, especially if only one specific lens affected or if started after physical damage, you likely have hardware failure requiring professional repair.

Contact Apple Support or visit an Apple Store for free diagnostics. They can definitively determine if it's hardware or software and provide repair options.

For iPhones under warranty or AppleCare+, camera repairs may be free or low-cost. Even out-of-warranty repairs are often worth it compared to replacement cost.
