iPhone takes amazing photos when configured properly. If your photos look bad, this guide improves quality.

## 10 Ways to Improve Photo Quality

### 1. Clean Camera Lens
Smudges ruin photos. Wipe with microfiber cloth daily.

### 2. Use HDR
Settings > Camera > Auto HDR > ON. Dramatically improves dynamic range.

### 3. Enable High Efficiency
Settings > Camera > Formats > High Efficiency (HEIF). Better quality, less space.

### 4. Proper Lighting
Take photos in good light. Avoid very dark or very bright conditions.

### 5. Hold iPhone Steady
Camera shake causes blur. Hold with both hands, tuck elbows, use volume button.

### 6. Tap to Focus
Always tap subject before shooting. Ensures proper focus.

### 7. Avoid Digital Zoom
Zoom reduces quality. Move closer instead or crop later.

### 8. Use Gridlines
Settings > Camera > Grid > ON. Helps composition and level horizon.

### 9. Update iOS
Camera improvements in updates. Settings > General > Software Update.

### 10. Learn Camera Features
Use Portrait, Night, Pano modes appropriately. Each optimized for specific scenarios.
