# ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting Email Not Received

## Let's Debug Step by Step

### Step 1: Check Vercel Function Logs (IMPORTANT)

This will show us the exact error:

1. **Go to:** https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. **Click** your **iFixGuide** project
3. **Click** "Logs" tab (or "Functions" â†’ "Logs")
4. **Look for** `/api/newsletter` entries (from your test)
5. **Check for errors** in red

**What to look for:**
- "401 Unauthorized" = API key wrong
- "403 Forbidden" = API key invalid
- "Email sending error" = Resend issue
- Success messages = working!

**Tell me what you see in the logs!**

### Step 2: Verify Resend API Key is Correct

**Common issues:**
1. **API key has extra spaces** when copied
2. **Wrong key type** (need full access key, not restricted)
3. **Key wasn't copied completely**

**Double-check in Vercel:**
1. Settings â†’ Environment Variables
2. Click "Edit" on RESEND_API_KEY
3. Verify it starts with `re_` and has no spaces
4. Should look like: `re_a1b2c3d4...` (long random string)

---

### Step 3: Check Resend Account Status

**Verify your Resend account:**

1. **Go to:** https://resend.com
2. **Check** if email verification complete
3. **Go to:** https://resend.com/emails
4. **Look for** test emails you sent
5. **Status should show:**
   - "Delivered" = emails sent successfully
   - "Failed" = shows error reason
   - Nothing shown = never attempted (API key issue)

---

### Step 4: Verify Deployment Picked Up Variable

**Check deployment has environment variable:**

1. Vercel Dashboard â†’ iFixGuide
2. **Deployments** tab
3. Click on latest deployment
4. Scroll to **"Environment Variables"** section
5. Should see `RESEND_API_KEY` listed

**If NOT listed:**
- Variable wasn't available during build
- Need to redeploy AFTER adding variable

## ðŸš¨ Most Common Issues

### Issue 1: Resend Account Not Verified

**Solution:**
1. Check email you signed up with
2. Click verification link from Resend
3. Account must be verified to send emails

### Issue 2: Using Default "onboarding@resend.dev" Email

**The code uses:** `from: 'iFixGuide <onboarding@resend.dev>'`

**This has limits:**
- Works for testing
- Limited to 1-2 emails
- **Need to verify your domain for production**

**Quick fix for testing:**
Check if Resend allows `onboarding@resend.dev` in your account tier.

### Issue 3: API Key Missing Permissions

**Check:**
1. Resend dashboard â†’ API Keys
2. Your key should have "Full Access"
3. If "Sending Access" only, create new key with Full Access

## ðŸ”§ Quick Diagnostic Test

**Let me help you check logs. Tell me:**

1. **In Vercel Logs**, do you see:
   - Any `/api/newsletter` entries?
   - Any error messages?
   - "Email sending error" messages?
   - Or nothing at all?

2. **In Resend Dashboard** (https://resend.com/emails):
   - Do you see any email attempts?
   - What status do they show?
   - Any error messages?

**Share what you see and I'll tell you exactly how to fix it!**

## ðŸŽ¯ Alternative: Test with Postman/Console

**Check if Resend API key works at all:**

Visit Resend dashboard and use their built-in tester:
1. https://resend.com/api-keys
2. Click your API key
3. Use "Send Test Email" button
4. Send to contact.ifixguide@gmail.com
5. If this works, API key is valid - issue is elsewhere

---

## ðŸ’¡ Temporary Alternative: Use Formspree

**If Resend is complex, use Formspree (easier):**

1. **Sign up:** https://formspree.io (free)
2. **Create form** for iFixGuide
3. **Get form endpoint** (URL they provide)
4. **I'll update** the API routes to use Formspree instead
5. **Much simpler** - no API key management

**Want to try Formspree instead?** Tell me and I'll set it up for you!
